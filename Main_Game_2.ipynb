    "Fifth Annual Data Science Bowl will analyze digital game play to help build more effective educational media tools for children. The competition will look at advancements in early childhood education. The results will lead to better designed games and improved learning outcomes, empowering children, parents, caregivers and educators across the globe with insights into how young children learn through media and which approaches work best to help them build on foundational learning skills.\n",
    "To better understand these challenges and develop the most effective approaches to high-quality early educational media, Booz Allen Hamilton and Kaggle launched the fifth annual Data Science Bowl, the world's largest data science competition focused on social good.\n",
    "Participants will be provided with anonymous gameplay data from the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app, which was developed as a part of the CPB-PBS Ready to Learn Initiative with funding from the U.S. Department of Education. They will be tasked with **creating algorithms that utilize information about how players use the app to determine what they know and are learning from the experience**, in order to discover important relationships between their engagement with educational media and learning. The insights gleaned from these solutions will help PBS KIDS and other organizations create new solutions, content and products that help ensure each and every user has the best chance to learn important skills, helping improve childhood learning access and achievement.\n",

    "Exposure ---> Exploration ---> Practice ---> Demonstration(as in demonstration of knowledge)\n",
    "In the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app, **children ages 3 to 5** learn early **STEM concepts focused on length, width, capacity, and weight** while going on an adventure through Treetop City, Magma Peak, and Crystal Caves. Joined by their favorite PBS KIDS characters from Dinosaur Train, Peg + Cat, and Sid the Science Kid, children can also collect rewards and unlock digital toys as they play. At the same time, caregivers can monitor and expand upon what their child is learning using a free companion app: PBS KIDS Super Vision.\n",
    "Parents can track the skills in which their kids excel, and the skills where they may need more practice. The app also provides tips and related activity ideas to extend learning into daily activities and family time.\n",
    "The PBS KIDS Measure Up! app, children navigate a map and complete various levels(media types):\n",
    "  1. Clip(Exposure)\n",
    "     - Interstitials/Introductory\n",
    "     - Longer(2-3 Minutes)/Familiar with problem\n",
    "  2. Activities(Practice): No subjective/There is cause and effect\n",
    "  3. Games(Practice): with the goal of solving problems/ There is an option of replay\n",
    "  4. Assessments(Measure player's knowledge/skills): number of incommect and number of accuracy group\n",

    "The intent of the competition is to use the gameplay data to forecast how many attempts a child will take to pass a given assessment (an incorrect answer is counted as an attempt).\n",
    "Each application install is represented by an installation_id. This will typically correspond to one child, but you should expect noise from issues such as shared devices.\n",
    "Note that the training set contains many installation_ids which never took assessments, whereas every installation_id in the test set made an attempt on at least one assessment.\n",
    "The outcomes in this competition are grouped into 4 groups (labeled accuracy_group in the data):\n",
    "\n",
    "3: the assessment was solved on the first attempt\n",
